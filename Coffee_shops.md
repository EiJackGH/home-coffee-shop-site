## ☕ The Brew Guide
Precision is key to a perfect cup. Use these ratios as a baseline for the "Home Brew Lab" experiments.

| Method | Ratio (Coffee:Water) | Coffee (g) | Water (g/ml) | Grind Size |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Hario V60** | 1:15 | 20g | 300ml | Medium-Fine |
| **AeroPress** | 1:13 | 17g | 220ml | Fine |
| **French Press** | 1:12 | 30g | 360ml | Coarse |
| **Chemex** | 1:16 | 40g | 640ml | Medium-Coarse |

### 🔬 The Golden Rule
For most pour-over methods, the **Golden Ratio** is **1:17** (1 gram of coffee for every 17 grams of water). This provides a balanced extraction that highlights the bean's natural acidity and sweetness.
